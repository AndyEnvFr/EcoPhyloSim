Description: This package is designed to simulate and analyse species community assembly processes. It allows the user to implement different mechanisms of community assembly such as environmental filtering, competitive exclusion or dispersal limitation. These mechanisms can be combined or activated seprately, which allows the user to identify biogeographic or phylogenetic patterns exclusively correlated with a certain mechanism or combination of mechanisms.
